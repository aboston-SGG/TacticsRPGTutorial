# Episode 2: Grid Instantiation

In this [video](https://youtu.be/QkTLsIb23MQ) we write our first bit of code and instantiate a grid of tiles at runtime.

## New Scripts
- Tile.cs
  - Stores the grid position of the tile.
- GridManager.cs
  - Contains the settings for the map.
  - Instantiates a grid at runtime, changes the names and colors of the tiles, and stores the new tiles in a 2D array for future use.
